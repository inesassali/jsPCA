# jsPCA



**Joint Spatial PCA (jsPCA)** is a fast and interpretable method for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data across single or multiple tissue slices or samples. It identifies spatial domains and spatially variable genes by combining gene expression covariance with spatial autocorrelation into a simple mathematical framework.
